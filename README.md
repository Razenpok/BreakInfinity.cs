# BreakInfinity.cs
A C# port of [break_infinity.js](https://github.com/Patashu/break_infinity.js) - a solution for incremental games which want to deal with very large numbers (bigger in magnitude than 1e308, up to as much as 1e(9e15) ) and want to prioritize speed over accuracy.

# Credits
[Patashu](https://github.com/Patashu) - for amazing library and major effort in porting to C#
